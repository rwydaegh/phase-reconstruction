# Digital Twin Field Reconstruction with Perturbation Analysis

## Introduction

When developing digital twins for electromagnetic field simulation, there are two fundamental approaches to deal with geometric perturbations (inaccuracies in the model compared to reality). This document summarizes these approaches and their implications based on analysis from the `verify_perturbation_effect.py` script.

## Approaches to Field Reconstruction

### 1. Normal Reconstruction (Physically Accurate)

This approach (labeled "Realistic perturbation scenario" in the code) represents what happens in a physically accurate simulation:

- **Implementation**: `forward_field = H_perturbed @ original_currents`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Uses perturbed geometry with fixed original/true currents
  - Maintains physical accuracy of current sources
  - Shows the direct impact of geometric errors on field prediction
  - Does not attempt to compensate for geometric inaccuracies

### 2. Current Optimization (Measurement-Matching)

This approach (labeled "Overfitting scenario" in the code) focuses on matching the measured field:

- **Implementation**: `perturbed_overfitting_field, _ = reconstruct_field_from_magnitude(H_perturbed, np.abs(original_true_field), config)`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Uses perturbed geometry with mathematically optimized currents
  - Adjusts currents through phase retrieval to match the observed field despite geometric errors
  - Prioritizes field prediction accuracy over physical accuracy of currents
  - Actively compensates for geometric inaccuracies

## Comparison

| Aspect | Normal Reconstruction | Current Optimization |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Current Values | Fixed at true/original values | Mathematically optimized |
| Physical Accuracy | Higher (maintains true currents) | Lower (currents may not match reality) |
| Field Prediction Accuracy | Lower when geometry has errors | Higher (compensates for geometry errors) |
| Parameter Freedom | Restricted | More flexible |
| Application | When current values themselves are important | When field prediction is the primary goal |

## Practical Implications

For practical digital twin applications, the choice depends on your primary goals:

- **Choose Normal Reconstruction when**:
  - The physical accuracy of current sources is critical
  - You're using the model to understand the currents themselves
  - You have high confidence in your geometric model

- **Choose Current Optimization when**:
  - Field prediction accuracy is the primary goal
  - Your digital twin has known geometric inaccuracies
  - You don't need physically accurate current values
  - You want your simulation to closely match measurements

## Conclusion

The term "overfitting" for the current optimization approach may be misleading in practical applications. If your goal is to have a digital twin that accurately predicts field measurements, then optimizing currents to compensate for geometric errors is a valid and useful technique. This approach acknowledges that perfect geometric modeling is often challenging, and parameter optimization can be an effective way to achieve good predictive performance despite model limitations.

The script's comparison between these approaches (particularly in `realistic_vs_overfitting.png`) helps quantify exactly how much improvement in field prediction can be achieved through current optimization at different levels of geometric perturbation.

# Performance Analysis Report

This document summarizes the performance characteristics of the field reconstruction simulation based on profiling and benchmarking results obtained using the tools in the `profiling_new` package.

## 1. Profiling Insights

*(This section should be filled with observations from `cProfile` runs using `profiler.py`)*

- **Execution Time:** Total time for a typical simulation run under configuration X.
- **Bottlenecks:** Identify the most time-consuming functions (e.g., using `tottime` sort).
    - Function A: X%
    - Function B: Y%
    - ...
- **Cumulative Time:** Identify functions that, including their callees, consume significant time (e.g., using `cumtime` sort).
    - Function C (and its children): Z%
    - ...
- **Call Counts:** Functions called very frequently.
- **Key Observations:**
    - [Observation 1, e.g., SVD computation dominates runtime]
    - [Observation 2, e.g., Channel matrix creation is the second major contributor]
    - [Observation 3, e.g., Specific utility function called excessively]

## 2. Benchmarking Results

*(This section should summarize results from `benchmarker.py`)*

### 2.1 Channel Matrix Creation

- **Comparison:** Original vs. Optimized (e.g., using `scipy.cdist`).
- **Scaling:** How does performance scale with resolution? (Include plot if generated)
- **Average Speedup:** X.Xx across tested resolutions.
- **Observations:** [e.g., Optimized version shows significant improvement, especially at higher resolutions.]

### 2.2 [Benchmark Task 2 - e.g., SVD Methods]

- **Comparison:** [e.g., Standard vs. Randomized SVD]
- **Scaling:** [e.g., Performance scaling with matrix size (related to resolution/sources)]
- **Average Speedup:** Y.Yx
- **Observations:** [e.g., Randomized SVD offers benefits for large matrices but has higher overhead for small ones.]

### 2.3 [Benchmark Task 3 - e.g., Phase Retrieval Algorithm]

- **Comparison:** [e.g., Original vs. Optimized GS algorithm]
- **Scaling:** [e.g., Performance scaling with iterations or resolution]
- **Average Speedup:** Z.Zx
- **Observations:** [e.g., Optimizations in matrix operations yield consistent speedup.]

*(Add sections for other benchmarked components)*

## 3. Scaling Analysis

*(Similar to the original PERFORMANCE_SCALING.md, analyze how performance scales with key parameters based on benchmark data)*

- **Resolution Scaling:** (e.g., O(N^2), O(N^3)?) Dominant factors.
- **Number of Sources Scaling:** (e.g., Linear, Sublinear?) Impact on different components.
- **Convergence Threshold / Iterations Scaling:** Algorithmic impact.

## 4. Optimization Recommendations

*(Based on profiling and benchmarking, suggest areas for further optimization)*

1.  **[Area 1, e.g., SVD]:** [Specific suggestions, e.g., Explore GPU acceleration, investigate alternative algorithms like PROPACK].
2.  **[Area 2, e.g., Memory Usage]:** [Suggestions, e.g., Use sparse matrices if applicable, check for memory leaks].
3.  **[Area 3, e.g., Algorithm Logic]:** [Suggestions, e.g., Reduce redundant computations, improve convergence criteria].

## Conclusion

Overall assessment of the current performance state and the effectiveness of implemented optimizations. Outline potential next steps for performance improvements.
